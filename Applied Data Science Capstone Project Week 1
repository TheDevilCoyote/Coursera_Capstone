Introduction/Business Problem:
An advertising company in New York City is having trouble finding places to advertise to tourists and visitors to New York City. 
I will be using the Foursquare location data to help find popular spots for them to advertise. With the data I will provide them 
they will be able to not only make more ad revenue but they will also be able to help tourists and visitors find where it is they 
should be going.
Data Section:
I will be using Foursquare's location data to find some of the most popular tourist location in New York City. 
I will be looking at the rating of each location as well as how many people actually visit the location per day. 
An example of what this would look like would be how many people visit Central Park in a given day.
